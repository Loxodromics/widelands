// Ramp units: DitherProgram sets the ramp to 1 at a triangle vertex incident
// to the overlay terrain and 0 elsewhere, so 1 means "at the overlay" and 0
// "as far from it as this triangle goes". Because incidence belongs to the
// vertex, not the triangle, two triangles sharing an edge agree along it and
// the coverage field is continuous across the whole mesh -- the ramp is a
// crude distance-to-the-terrain-boundary, not a per-triangle gradient. The
// shape octave lets the boundary wander regionally, the mid octave gives it
// local irregularity.
//
// Band budget: at centre 0.90 there is only 0.10 of headroom to the ramp's
// 1 end, less than the shape octaves can produce (0.06 + 0.14 = 0.20), so
// dither.fp's clamp to [-(1 - kDitherCentre), kDitherCentre] is load-bearing
// rather than a safety net -- it binds wherever the shape field drops below
// -0.10 and holds the band at the overlay instead of letting it retract past.
// Density there falls to half the ceiling, which reads as extra speckle.
//
// The constants below are traced to edge.png's measured profile: 89%
// coverage at the shared edge, zero by ramp 0.75, 50% point at ramp 0.86.
// That coverage figure is a hole density, not an opacity -- edge.png was a
// 1-bit mask stretched over the triangle at roughly one texel per screen
// pixel at zoom 1, so even its "full" end kept 11% holes. dither_grain()
// (terrain_variation.glsl) reproduces that density with a uniform hash, so
// kDitherMaxCoverage sets it directly and dither.fp applies it as a threshold
// rather than an opacity multiply. The perforation is what makes the boundary
// read as Settlers-2 grain instead of a clean vector edge.
//
// kDitherCentre has a hard floor that has nothing to do with taste. Where a
// terrain is one triangle wide and both neighbours dither into it -- a beach
// between grass and water is the usual case -- it survives only where the
// effective threshold stays above 0.5, so the strip keeps 2t - 1 of its width.
// With the shape octaves reaching 0.20, t bottoms out at centre - 0.20: 0.70
// at centre 0.90, keeping a third of the strip at its worst. At 0.72 that
// floor is 0.52 and the strip vanishes in patches. Confirmed by capture over
// {0.72, 0.79, 0.86, 0.92}.

// kDitherGrainFadeMin/Max: var_texture_position is map pixels / 64 on both

// pixels_per_cell is exactly 1 / zoom -- one grain cell per screen pixel at
// the default zoom (MapView::reset_zoom()). The fade must therefore hold full
// grain at 1.0 and reach zero by 0.5 (zoom 2), which needs two independent
// endpoints. A clamp(pixels_per_cell - k, 0, 1) ties the fade's start to its

// game offers, k = 0.25 still leaves a quarter of it at zoom 2.
